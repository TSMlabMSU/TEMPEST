## A.  Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS)

- **Original field/discipline:** CFD

- **Plain language explanation:**

	- Solves complete Navier-Stokes equations without models of turbulent motions
	- Resolves all scales of motion: smallest scales (determined by molecular viscosity) to largest scales (determined by the fluid domain)

- **Why it matters for turbulence research:**

	- Provides "ground truth" for validating turbulence models / theories
		- High cost. limiting application to moderate Re
	- Critical validation tool for TEMPEST's ML modeling, ...
