**Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS)**
- CFD
- Solves complete Navier-Stokes equations without models of turbulent motions. Resolves all scales of motion: smallest scales (determined by molecular viscosity) to largest scales (determined by the fluid domain)
- Provides "ground truth" for validating turbulence models / theories. Validation for TEMPEST's ML modeling, etc.
